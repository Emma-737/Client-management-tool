This client management tool was created for a Champagne company in France. It is meant as an additional on top of the existing software. Acronyms such as 'BDE' are meant to represent different types of wine. 
This program was created on WING 101 using Python. It has an additional CSV file that needs to be included in order for the program to work. The expected outputs are a pie chart, a graph and a sentence with the 
quantity of bottles ordered in the past in the terminal.
